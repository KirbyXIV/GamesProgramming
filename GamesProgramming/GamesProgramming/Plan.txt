Game Concept: "Shadow Echo"
Premise:
You play as a character trapped in a haunted ruin where every move you make is echoed back by a 
ghostly "shadow" version of yourself after a delay — and if it touches you, you die.

Core Mechanics:
Movement

Top-down or side-scroller

Arrow keys to move

Shadow Clone

Every X seconds, a clone appears and retraces your exact movements from X seconds ago

If it catches up to you = game over

Objective

Reach the exit before your past catches you

Each level is a maze or puzzle that requires thinking ahead

Puzzle Elements

Doors, switches, timed platforms

Use your echo to trigger things, but avoid contact

Possible Expansions:
Multiple shadows with different delay times

Shadow gets smarter (can shortcut your path)

Light-based mechanics (shadows only appear in darkness)
